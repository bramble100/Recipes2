                    I love to design complex systems with high levels of automation including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence" target="_blank">AI</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotics" target="_blank">robotics</a>. I'm deeply interested in inventing new things that can augment the human experience.
